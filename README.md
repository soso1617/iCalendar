# iCalendar
A sample code of a kind of calendar. I create this project for MicroSoft interview testing. All the UI and creativity is designed by my self. No tableview or collectionview for reusing the cell for calender, I controlled them manually. This is a partial delivery project, hope you could get some takeaways from this project, thanks.
